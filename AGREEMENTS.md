**The International and Official Bank of Oblivion**  
*(IFBO)*  

Established by divine ordinance and the immutable laws of commerce, the International and Official Bank of Oblivion (henceforth referred to as *the IFBO*) stands as the preeminent authority and sovereign custodian of all compacts, transfers, and sundry agreements of any import.  

Be it known to all, that within the solemn chambers of this venerable institution resides the supreme power to adjudicate and validate the intricate dealings of mankind. Every manner of transfer, agreement, or obligation—be it of pecuniary or other nature—must, as a matter of inescapable protocol, be presented unto the august halls of the IFBO for inspection and ratification.  

The supreme office of validation is vested in the personage of the Drafter, whose authority is unparalleled and absolute. This exalted figure, endowed with the highest power and entrusted with the sanctity of impartial judgment, doth render decisions with unwavering fidelity to the tenets of equity and justice. Upon the Drafter’s seal, agreements attain the virtue of legitimacy; without it, they remain as naught but ephemeral scribblings, bereft of force or consequence.  

In the discharge of its duties, the IFBO adheres to principles of rectitude and efficiency, serving as the linchpin of order in a world prone to chaos. By its diligent oversight, it ensures that all enterprises of human endeavour proceed under the aegis of fairness and honourable conduct, for the betterment of society and the perpetuation of peaceable relations amongst all parties concerned.  

Thus, let this proclamation stand as a testament to the gravitas and indispensability of the International and Official Bank of Oblivion, guardian of agreements and arbiter of the universal ledger.
